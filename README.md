# Kotlin + Gradle + Nix = ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is an example starter template for your next Kotlin JVM app.

The template offers a ready-to-start project skeleton and development environment including linting (ktlint, detekt, sqlfluff and more), a [nix derivation](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/language/derivations) and a NixOS module (with tests!).

## Prerequisites

This project requires [Nix](https://nixos.org/) with [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) support for both the development and the build process - but nothing else!

## Development Environment

```bash
# Manually start development environment ...
nix develop
# ... or let direnv do it for you
direnv allow
```

You will be greeted with a list of all available commands.

## Make the template your own

- Search and replace `Example Application` and `example` (including folder names)
- Search for `TODO` to ensure you set licenses etc. properly
- Replace the Project license
- Have fun üöÄ
